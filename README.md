# Data Engineer routine

Algorithm for the ETL process in a Data Engineer's daily routine, with a detailed explanation and personal insights, implemented using Jupyter Notebook.

In this repository, I have examined typical tasks for a Data Engineer. In 'DE Exercice' you will find the assignment, and in 'DE Algorithm' my solution with a detailed explanation and my own perspective on the task. The solution was implemented using _Jupyter Notebook_. I used __Python__ and the __Pandas__ library.
