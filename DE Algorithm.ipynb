    "At first glance, the __'Quantity (Â£)'__ column caught my eye for two reasons - it has the ___currency name___ in the values and also contains ___negative___ values. Clearly, for financial analysis, the data type should be numeric, and the commonly used data type for this purpose is 'float' with two decimal places. Therefore, we should _remove_ the currency mention and _convert_ type.  \n",
    "As for the negative values, they deserve special attention. Initially, we might consider simply deleting this row because in the context of electricity consumption, negative values imply 'energy generation,' and we assume that the Glasgow office is not involved in energy production. However, upon closer examination, I notice that it pertains to only one day, unlike the other data, which represents reports for specific months. Furthermore, this row shares a similar account number with the one above it, where the office name and location match, but with the addition of _'-re'_, which could indicate a debt or a case where the company initially reserved more electricity than it used, for instance. So, I would definitely _keep_ this row, although it could also be logically _combined_ with the one indicating the period to which it belongs. I would discuss this aspect with a colleague as the choice depends on the goals of further data analysis.    \n",
    "I also noticed the outlier values because the value of 5000 is significantly different from the average. I would discuss this with a more experienced colleague, but I personally find it quite logical that energy consumption and its cost increase in November as the daylight hours and temperature decrease compared to October. Although the values in November are twice as high as in December, this can be explained by the greater number of working days in the office in November compared to December and its calendar holidays. And even when comparing this value to the value for the same period but for a different office (Spain), it can be explained by geographical weather data and a significant _difference in the number of office employees_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I observe that __'Bill number'__ names follow different naming conventions for different offices. In my current solution, I did not modify this column as I believe that the naming logic is entirely unique to each office location and does not repeat. However, this can certainly be discussed with a colleague, as standardized bill _numbers_ might be necessary for analysis.\n",
